# Welcome to Iron Fists Sports
## Introduction

Sports web application is a one-stop-shop for all sports events developed by the IRON FIST. It is an AngularJS app built with a Ruby on Rails backend API. The app contains the following key features:

- A one-to-one relationship between Teams and Venues models as almost all teams have their own respective venues.

- Close to a total of 2000 lines of seed data containing five professional leagues including, Baseball (MLB), Soccer (MLS), Basketball (NBA), and Hockey (NHL), Football(NFL), and their associated venues.

- API calls to events associated with each venue or team. It allows users to purchase tickets relating to a particular event.

- API calls to a current 10 day weather forecast associated with the selected venue. Local weather is queried by the venues zipcode.

- A map from google api.

- Bootstrap is added to make the web application more user friendly.
